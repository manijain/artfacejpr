	Add migration on artists table. Datatype of years changed from integer to string.


3. changes in artist table (Added some columns). See migration
	(done all changes accordingly, check all your work related to artist year)
	(need to drop birth and death year, but still left for pe=rventing being effected all changes by all team)

4.	Wishlist Controller 
	method - update (some changes)
	method - wishlist_advanced_artist_match (create)

5. All birth_year and death_year is changed

6.I think redirection of add new offer (when user crossed the limit of adding new offers) is wrong on front-end. 
There is <redirect_to '/offer/show'>  in offer_controller, while nothing is defined on this page. So it should be <redirect_to '/dashboard/sell-art-area'> or change it to according to your need who are working on front-end.

7. Changes from "for sale and lend" in properties instead of "for sale or lend"

8. It needs chenges(trim before and after white-spaces) all placed where data is being stored on db.
